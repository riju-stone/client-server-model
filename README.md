# client-server-model
A simple client-server model implemented in Python

# Client-Server
The Client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions task or workload between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters called clients. In the client-server architecture, when the client computer sends a request for data to the server through the internet, the server accepts the requested process and deliver the data packets requested back to the client. Clients do not share any of their resources. Examples of Client-Server Model are Email, World Wide Web, etc.

## How the Client-Server Model works ?
In this article we are going to take a dive into the Client-Server model and have a look at how the Internet works via, web browsers. This article will help us in having a solid foundation of the WEB and help in working with WEB technologies with ease.
- `Client`: When we talk the word Client, it mean to talk of a person or an organization using a particular service. Similarly in the digital world a Client is a computer (Host) i.e. capable of receiving information or using a particular service from the service providers (Servers).
- `Servers`: Similarly, when we talk the word Servers, It mean a person or medium that serves something. Similarly in this digital world a Server is a remote computer which provides information (data) or access to particular services.
